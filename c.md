# C

## CALS
A standard for representing tables in SGML/XML. For more information, see [CALS Table Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CALS_Table_Model).

## character styles
A collection of character formatting attributes that can be applied to text.

## CMS
Stands for Content Management System. A CMS is a computer software used to manage the creation and modification of digital content.

## CSS
Stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed. To learn more, see [CSS Introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_intro.asp).

## Content XML (CXML)
An intermediary file type called CXML which harmonises Word documents—or any type of source content—with dynamic Adobe InDesign templates. For more information, see the [CXML 3.2 documentation](https://help.typefi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001485775).

## converter
Code that is embedded into Typefi plug-ins to perform Typefi-specific actions. 

More specifically, a converter is a utility, typically with a command-line interface for internal use and development, which applies XSL transforms (optionally) and other functionality not supported by XSLT. For example, you would need a converter to extract an image in the DOCX-to-CXML converter, or to read a DOCX template file in the CXML-to-DOCX converter because IDML and DOCX files are non-XML ZIP files and cannot be transformed with standard XSLT.

## copyfit
To fit (printer's copy) to the required space (as by cutting or expanding the copy or the space and by the use of different-size typefaces, measures, and leading).

## cross-reference
A reference to another text or part of a text, typically given in order to elaborate on a point.

## cruft
Unproductive, wasteful, doesn’t add value, obsolete, redundant.
